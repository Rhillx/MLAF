Mobile Lost and Found

Mission: Our mission is to assist in the aide of retrieving lost items by offering a platform facilitating the process of a lost and found dynamic. 
Concept: Users will be able to recover items/ valuables they have lost by opening MLAF, posting to app the  item in which theyâ€™ve lost; description, last place of possession, possibly offer reward for finding, etc. Then user will be able to communicate with finder in order to retrieve item. 
 
Vision of how App will operate: 
Once signed into MLAF, user can swipe left if Item has been found, or swipe right if item has been lost. This will simplify using the app and also create a fun dynamic in utilizing this app.
